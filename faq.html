        <h2 class="question">What is a form versus a schedule?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>A form is a document provided by a tax authority, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States, that taxpayers use to report their income, deductions, credits, and other pertinent tax information. Tax forms typically cover a broad range of tax-related topics, such as income from wages, interest, dividends, self-employment earnings, and capital gains.
A schedule is an additional document that you may be required to complete if you are reporting certain types of income. Schedules are often used to report various types of income, deductions, credits, or other tax-related items in more detail than what can be accommodated directly on the main tax form.

        <h2 class="question">What are the differences between filing status:</h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <ul>
            <li>Single: A single filer is a taxpayer who are unmarried, divorced, or legally separated from their spouse.</li>
            <li>Married joint: If the taxpaper is married, they can file taxes jointly with their spouse. If one of the spouses die during the tax year, the widow can still file the tax in this status. This filing status usually results in lower taxes compared to filing separately, and it may make you eligible for certain tax credits and deductions that you wouldn't qualify for if filing separately. Both spouses are jointly responsible for the tax liability and any errors on the return.</li>
            <li>Married separate: Married couples can file separately. This filing status usually results in higher taxes compared to filing jointly and receive fewer tax benefits. However, it can benefit you in rare situations. If you or your spouse have significant out-of-pocket medical expenses, filing separately can help maximize deductions, especially if your combined income makes it difficult to exceed the AGI threshold for medical expense deductions. If your student loan repayment plan is based on your tax return income, filing separately might result in lower monthly payments, making repayment more manageable. When anticipating divorce, filing separately can prevent one spouse from being held accountable for the other's tax liabilities, particularly in cases where the divorce is not amicable.</li>
            <li>Head of household: To qualify as head of household, you must be unmarried, pay more than half the cost of maintaining a home for yourself and a qualifying person (such as a dependent child or relative), and meet other criteria.</li>
            <li>Qualifying surviving spouse: This filing status is available for widows and widowers for two years following the year of their spouse's death, provided they have a dependent child and meet certain conditions.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2 class="question">How do I know if I have had a capital gain or loss?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>You have had a capital gain if you sell the asset for more than your adjusted basis. You have had a capital loss if you sell the asset for less than your adjusted basis.</p>
          <p>A capital gains rate of 0% applies if your taxable income is less than or equal to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>$44,625 for single and married filing separately</li>
            <li>$89,250 for married filing jointly and qualifying surviving spouse</li>
            <li>$59,750 for head of household</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A capital gains rate of 15% applies if your taxable income is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>more than $44,625 but less than or equal to $492,300 for single</li>
            <li>more than $44,625 but less than or equal to $276,900 for married filing separately</li>
            <li>more than $89,250 but less than or equal to $553,850 for married filing jointly and qualifying surviving spouse</li>
            <li>more than $59,750 but less than or equal to $523,050 for head of household</li>
          </ul>
          <p>However, a capital gains rate of 20% applies to the extent that your taxable income exceeds the thresholds set for the 15% capital gain rate.</p>
          <p>There are a few other exceptions where capital gains may be taxed at rates greater than 20%:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The taxable part of a gain from selling section 1202 qualified small business stock is taxed at a maximum 28% rate.</li>
            <li>Net capital gains from selling collectibles (such as coins or art) are taxed at a maximum 28% rate.
</li>
            <li>The portion of any unrecaptured section 1250 gain from selling section 1250 real property is taxed at a maximum 25% rate.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can report most sales and other capital transactions and calculate capital gain or loss on Form 8949 and summarize capital gains and deductible capital losses on Schedule D of Form 1040.</p>

            <li>Have worked and earned income under $63,398</li>
            <li>Have investment income below $11,000 in the tax year</li>
            <li>Have a valid Social Security number by the due date of your tax return</li>
            <li>Be a US citizen or resident alien all year</li>
            <li>Not file Form 2555 for Foreign earned income</li>
            <li>Meet certain rules if you are separated from your spouse and not filing a joint tax return</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you are a member of the military, there are two additional rules if you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Get nontaxable military pay such as combat pay or a housing allowance or subsistence allowance</li>
            <li>Were stationed outside the United States</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Include the rental value of the home you live in, or the housing allowance, if it was provided to you by the church</li>
            <li>Include income you get for working as a minister if you are an employee</li>
